# Tax Modernization Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification ✅

### Service Layer Validation
- [x] **TaxJurisdictionService**: 67 tests passing, full CRUD operations
- [x] **CompanyEstablishmentService**: Complete establishment management with API integration
- [x] **TaxService**: Enhanced with multi-jurisdiction context resolution
- [x] **CrossBorderTaxValidator**: Comprehensive EU compliance and export validation
- [x] **InvoiceService**: Tax context integration methods (`create_with_tax_context`, `update_with_tax_context`)

### Performance Optimizations Verified
- [x] **Caching**: 5-minute TTL implemented for all tax-related data
- [x] **Debouncing**: 300ms for establishment changes, 1000ms for cross-border validation
- [x] **Request Deduplication**: Signature-based cache keys prevent duplicate API calls
- [x] **Timeout Handling**: 15-second timeout for all tax-related API calls
- [x] **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup on controller disconnect

### UI/UX Components Ready
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- [x] **Invoice Forms**: Tax context integration with real-time validation
- [x] **Cross-border Validation**: Live transaction validation with visual feedback
- [x] **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly messages
- [x] **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators for all async operations

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Review and Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
cd /Users/ludo/code/albaranes/client
docker-compose exec web bash -c "RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec spec/services/tax* spec/services/company_establishment* spec/services/cross_border* --format progress"

# Verify controller integration
docker-compose exec web bash -c "RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/invoices_controller_spec.rb --format progress"

# Expected Results:
# - 67 tax-related service tests passing (100%)
# - 52 invoice controller tests passing (100%)
```

### 2. Asset Compilation and Optimization
```bash
# Compile assets for production
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile

# Verify JavaScript controllers are compiled
ls -la public/assets/controllers/invoice_form_controller-*.js
ls -la public/assets/controllers/cross_border_validator_controller-*.js
```

### 3. Database Migration Verification
```bash
# Ensure all tax-related migrations are applied
rails db:migrate:status | grep -E "(tax|establishment|jurisdiction)"

# Verify seed data is present
rails console -e production
> TaxJurisdiction.count # Should be 4 (ESP, PRT, POL, MEX)
> CompanyEstablishment.count # Should be > 0 for existing companies
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Verify tax-related environment variables
echo $TAX_CALCULATION_TIMEOUT # Should be 15000 (ms)
echo $TAX_CACHE_TTL # Should be 300 (seconds)
echo $CROSS_BORDER_VALIDATION_ENABLED # Should be true

# API endpoint verification
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" $API_BASE_URL/api/v1/tax_jurisdictions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" $API_BASE_URL/api/v1/company_establishments
```

### 5. Performance Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Configure monitoring for tax-related endpoints
# Add to monitoring system:
# - /api/v1/tax/resolve_context (response time should be < 500ms)
# - /api/v1/tax/validate_cross_border (response time should be < 1000ms)
# - JavaScript controller load times (should be < 100ms)

# Memory usage monitoring for caching
# - tax_context_cache size
# - establishment_cache size
# - validation_cache size
```

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Functional Testing
- [ ] **Invoice Creation**: Create invoices with different establishments
- [ ] **Tax Context Resolution**: Verify automatic context detection works
- [ ] **Cross-border Validation**: Test EU B2B, B2C, and export scenarios
- [ ] **Performance**: Verify caching reduces API calls on repeated actions
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test forms on mobile devices

### 2. Integration Testing
- [ ] **API Communication**: Verify all tax service calls return expected data
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test behavior when tax services are unavailable
- [ ] **Cache Performance**: Verify cache TTL and cleanup works correctly
- [ ] **Real-time Validation**: Test debouncing and request deduplication

### 3. User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] **Invoice Workflow**: Complete invoice creation with tax context
- [ ] **Establishment Management**: Create and manage company establishments
- [ ] **Cross-border Compliance**: Validate EU compliance warnings and recommendations
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Test graceful handling of service failures

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
```yaml
# Response Times
tax_context_resolution_time: < 500ms (95th percentile)
cross_border_validation_time: < 1000ms (95th percentile)
invoice_creation_with_tax_time: < 2000ms (95th percentile)

# Error Rates
tax_service_error_rate: < 1%
cross_border_validation_error_rate: < 0.5%
cache_miss_rate: < 10% (after initial load)

# Cache Performance
tax_context_cache_hit_ratio: > 80%
establishment_cache_hit_ratio: > 90%
validation_cache_hit_ratio: > 75%
```

### Alert Thresholds
```yaml
# Critical Alerts
- tax_service_availability < 95%
- invoice_creation_failure_rate > 5%
- cross_border_validation_timeout > 15s

# Warning Alerts
- tax_context_resolution_time > 1s
- cache_miss_rate > 20%
- javascript_error_rate > 2%
```

## Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Disable tax modernization features
ENABLE_TAX_MODERNIZATION=false rails restart

# Fallback to basic tax calculation
ENABLE_CROSS_BORDER_VALIDATION=false rails restart
```

### Full Rollback (< 15 minutes)
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
git checkout [previous-commit-hash]
docker-compose build web
docker-compose up -d web

# Verify rollback success
curl -f /health/tax_services
```

## Feature Flags

### Gradual Rollout Configuration
```yaml
# Enable for specific companies first
ENABLE_TAX_MODERNIZATION_COMPANY_IDS: "1,2,3"

# Enable for specific user roles
ENABLE_TAX_MODERNIZATION_ROLES: "admin,accountant"

# Enable cross-border validation separately
ENABLE_CROSS_BORDER_VALIDATION: true

# Performance-based toggling
ENABLE_CACHING: true
ENABLE_DEBOUNCING: true
```
